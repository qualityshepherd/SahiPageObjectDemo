==================

A demonstration of my page object pattern for Sahi (Javascript)
by Brian Ray ~ brian@qualityshepherd.com

NOTE: This code requires Sahi v5.x or later... 

The code herein are working, example Sahi tests that make use of page objects. To run the code:

1. Install and start Sahi
2. Add the files to your scripts folder ([sahi folder]/userdata/scripts/)
3. Run each individual test or
4. Run the pageObjectTests.suite via bin/runPageObjectTests.bat
